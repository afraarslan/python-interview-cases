# Python Interview Cases

This repository contains two cases that can be asked in python interviews. 

## Question 1 - Anagram
 It is a python script that reads 2 strings from command line and finds out whether they are anagrams or not. If they are not anagrams, 
 then the script should find and print the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. 
 Otherwise, just print that *they are anagrams*.
 
## Question 2 - Top seller

* top seller n products in given date range (product name & quantity)
* top seller n stores in given date range (store name & quantity)
* top seller n brands in given date range (brand & quantity)
* top seller n cities in given date range (city & quantity)
